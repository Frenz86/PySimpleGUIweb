Creating a Windows .EXE File

pip install PyInstaller

pyinstaller -wF timer.py

To create your EXE file from your program that uses PySimpleGUI, my_program.py, enter this command in your Windows command prompt:

pyinstaller -wF my_program.py
You will be left with a single file, my_program.exe, located in a folder named dist under the folder where you executed the pyinstaller command.
